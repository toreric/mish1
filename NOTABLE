Notable properties
==================

This system should be available for any computer (Windows, Mac, Linux) with
  a web browser; from a server, a cloud, or locally, when required support
  software is available (including Nodejs and a some others)

Common image formats should be accepted, TIFF included. Also GIF images
  can be shown using fake-named 'PNG GIFs' as thumbnail/slideshow images,
  though, of course, without any metadata

Image descriptions are contained in the metadata of the original image
  (exception: GIFs). All texts and file names will be freely searchable
  over albums. This means that any image collection (directory/folder/
  album) may be "dis-structured" without loss of information regarding 
  any idividual image, except their sequencing and hide status in the
  directory/album 

Thumbnail images and slideshow images are automatically regenerated
  when needed (example: when the original image is updated/edited; a problem is to make changes instantly visible due to browser caching)

Thumbnail and slideshow images live in the same directory as their ori-
  ginals. They are (fake) PNG files prefixed with _mini_ and  _show_,
  respectively. Actually, real PNGs are limited, most are JPEGs.

Image names (file names without extensions) must be unique within an
  album, for example, namex.png and namex.jpg may not co-exist (NOTE:
  still not entirely automatically prohibited). File names may not
  contain spaces (so far)

Any image may be shown in several albums through symlinks

Image albums, directories distuingished by the indicator file named 
  '.imdb', are leafs in directory trees with image files. Albums may be
  pre-populated or filled by image uploads

Any album will contain its own auto-generated list of image names,
  called _imdb_order.txt, with the desired image show order, and other
  'show-time properties', such as hide/show settings

The GUI is meant to be intuitive and self-explaining, with an image
  'content menu'. The user is encouraged to look att 'tool tip' texts.
  There is an image temporary-marking tool, and the thumbnails are
  draggable into desired order, which may be saved. 
  There are no manuals except '?' buttons

The ESC key has generally a 'close window/go back/leave' meaning

The 'show-time design' should be ready for wall projection to any meeting.
  At show time, the slide show may be run entirely from a keyboard,
  supplemented by mouse pointing (the cursor appearance should neatly
  permit useful pointing when needed)
